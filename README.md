🚀 Deploying an Apache2 Server with Docker on Ubuntu 22.04 🐳
As part of my learning journey in containerization technologies, I recently worked on installing and using Docker to deploy an Apache2 web server. 🔥
💡 Key steps of the project:
✅ Installing Docker on Ubuntu 22.04 and verifying its functionality.
✅ Creating a custom Docker image with a Dockerfile integrating Apache2.
✅ Building and running the image to generate a functional container.
✅ Deploying an Apache2 server accessible via http://localhost:8080.
✅ Customizing the web page directly within the container.
✅ Managing containers and images (start, stop, remove, cleanup).
🔎 Why Docker?
This project allowed me to explore Docker's power and flexibility in quickly deploying applications in isolated environments. With just a few commands, I was able to create a functional server, customize it, and manage it efficiently.
